## Bio

Hi there, my name is Ruth Enriquez! I recently earned my [Master's of Environmental Data Science degree (MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) from the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am an aspiring data scientist, and would love the opportunity to combine my passions for information technology, finance, data, and sustainability in my next career.

## Highlighted Experience

**Master's Capstone Project 2023:** [Evaluating Carbon Emissions from Electric Arc Furnace Steel Plants in the United States](https://bren.ucsb.edu/projects/evaluating-carbon-emissions-electric-arc-furnace-steel-plants-united-states)<br>
**Role:** Project Manager<br>
**Links:** [Analysis](https://github.com/steeltracker/carbon-analysis) & [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/steel.tracker/viz/2021USElectricSteelPlantCo2eTracker/EAFTotalPlantEmissions)

**Description:** Working with Global Energy Monitor our capstone group brought transparency in how much Scope 2 emissions were being produced by Electric Arc Furnace Steel Plants. We used four different data sets to paint us a complete picture of Scope 2 emissions. After standardizing our data using industry standards we created an interactive Tableau dashboard of our findings.

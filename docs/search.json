For my undergraduate degree I studied Management Information Systems and Finance at the Shilder College of Business. I had the pleasure of working in my field of study at Bank of Hawai’i.\nI started as a student assistant in the Information Technology (IT) department where I was tasked to do data entry. As I progressed through my career I also participated in Bank of Hawai’i’s internship program and Pathway to Professional Excellence management training program.\nAfter 6 years of working in IT Finance I gained a passion for telling a story through data and data visualization. I wanted to pivot my career to pursue my passions in sustainability. I am interested in working on food waste, corporate sustainability, and Scope 1 & 2 Emissions."

    "text": "I wanted to look at the relationship between food waste production and household income, specifically do households with higher income produce more food waste? I wanted to investigate this relationship because 10% of American’s suffer from food insecurity, yet every year we waste 40% of all food. Of the food waste produced in America 31% of it is produced at the wholesale & retail level. I wanted to see if there was an opportunity to divert edible food waste/excess to individuals instead of landfills. I think this is an important topic to investigate because everyone should have access to food. This topic is also important because reducing the amount of food waste in landfills can help reduce the amount of methane produced and help to mitigate climate change. Doing a quick Google search, I see there are others wondering about the effects of socioeconomic status on food waste production. There is a research paper, Community social capital and status: The social dilemma of food waste, that look at the negative relationship food waste levels have related to local levels of social capital in Italy. However, I couldn’t find other’s asking a similar question for America. Though there seems to be a growing interest in food waste data and statistics. I think there is still a gap in the data collection of food waste produced in America therefore there isn’t a existing evidence on the question of do households with higher income produce more food waste in America."

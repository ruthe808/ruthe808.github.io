    "text": "Full BioHobbies\n\n\nA little bit more about me… before attending the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), I worked for Bank of Hawai’i, the largest local bank in the state. My career started with the bank when I was brought on as a student assistant. I was lucky to have managers that believed in my personal and professional development, check out my short testimony on the Bank of Hawaii IT Career page.\nMy managers nominated me for the bank’s internship program and their management training program. My manager wanted to continued to invest in my professional development and asked me consider pursuing a master’s in business administration (MBA). However I decided to go back to school to pursue something related to my passion for sustainability.\nMy passion for sustainability comes from being born and raised in Hawai’i. It was easy to fall in love with the environment spending most of my time growing up outdoors. But part of growing up in Hawai’i is also seeing how limited our natural resources are and how that affects us. In high school I had the opportunity to volunteer with Aloha Harvest. I saw how many people suffered from food insecurity and how an organization turned a problem, like food waste, into a solution to help to communities get fed.\nIdeally, I would love my next career to be one where I can combine my IT finance experience with my passion in sustainability and newly gained data science skills. I hope to work in green technology, corporate sustainability, food waste and/or environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG), but am open to other opportunities.\n\n\n\nTrying new restaurants with family and friends\nChecking out local coffee shops and farmer’s markets\nSpending time at the beach\nTraveling\n\n“It seems that the more places I see and experience, the bigger I realize the world to be. The more I become aware of, the more I realize how relatively little I know of it, how many places I have still to go, how much more there is to learn.” - Anthony Bourdain\nA map of my travels so far :)"

    "text": "I wanted to look at the relationship between food waste production and household income, specifically do households with higher income produce more food waste? I wanted to investigate this relationship because 10% of American’s suffer from food insecurity, yet every year we waste 40% of all food. Of the food waste produced in America 31% of it is produced at the wholesale & retail level. I wanted to see if there was an opportunity to divert edible food waste/excess to individuals instead of landfills. I think this is an important topic to investigate because everyone should have access to food. This topic is also important because reducing the amount of food waste in landfills can help reduce the amount of methane produced and help to mitigate climate change. Doing a quick Google search, I see there are others wondering about the effects of socioeconomic status on food waste production. There is a research paper, Community social capital and status: The social dilemma of food waste, that look at the negative relationship food waste levels have related to local levels of social capital in Italy. However, I couldn’t find other’s asking a similar question for America. Though there seems to be a growing interest in food waste data and statistics. I think there is still a gap in the data collection of food waste produced in America therefore there isn’t a existing evidence on the question of do households with higher income produce more food waste in America."

For this project, I decided to shrink my scope & to focus on food waste produced at the wholesale & retail level & household income in California counties.\nI quickly learned that most companies do not rigorously track food waste, so all the numbers I used from the EPA data are estimates. From the data the EPA was able to collect they ran it through an algorithm that produced low and high estimates of food wasted for the year. There was little transparency on how the EPA calculated the low and high food waste estimates.

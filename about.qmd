## Full Bio

I was born and raised in Hawai'i where I attended the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa. For my undergraduate degree I studied Management Information Systems and Finance at the Shilder College of Business. I had the pleasure of working in my field of study at Bank of Hawai'i.

I started as a student assistant in the Information Technology (IT) department where I was tasked to do data entry. As I progressed through my career I also participated in Bank of Hawai'i's internship program and Pathway to Professional Excellence management training program.

After 6 years of working in IT Finance I gained a passion for telling a story through data and data visualization. I wanted to pivot my career to pursue my passions in sustainability.

"It seems that the more places I see and experience, the bigger I realize the world to be. The more I become aware of, the more I realize how relatively little I know of it, how many places I have still to go, how much more there is to learn." - Anthony Bourdain
